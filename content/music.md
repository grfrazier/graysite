Apart from physics, I also enjoy playing and composing music semiprofessionally.
My primary instrument is saxophone, and I play and compose jazz music.


Outside playing the occasional gigs, I also enjoy trancribing solos in my freetime.
Below is a small selection of personal favorites, which I have typed.
Please contact me if you would prefer a transposed version.

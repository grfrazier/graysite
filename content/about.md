<!--# About Me-->

I am currently completing my Ph.D. at Johns Hopkins University under the supervision of Prof. Yi Li, where my research explores how topological electronic states and frustrated magnetism can give rise to novel forms of unconventional superconductivity.
[Below is my CV](#curriculum_vitae), and you can find more information about my research [here](/research).



Outside my work, you can find me playing saxophone semiprofessionally, and
I also enjoy composing and also transcribing jazz music.
I have handpicked a [few transcriptions](/music/) from some of my favorite solos.
